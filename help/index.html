The tasks are divided by task type and the last columns show the totals for the week. You can also see a month summary in the bottom left.<p>The times are shown in minutes, with the totals shown either in minutes or in hours:minutes format. You can change how the totals are displayed in the settings (Settings > Timing > Show totals in hh:mm format). To quickly change the format in which the totals are displayed, click on any cell that says TOTAL.<p>Hovering your mouse over any cell with a timig total (daily, weekly or monthly) will display the earnings of that period. You can configure your hourly wages in the settings (Settings > Misc > Hourly wage)<p>You can navigate to the previous or following week using the buttons "&lt;&lt;" and "&gt;&gt;". The button labeled "today" will show the current week, with the current day highlighted. You can also use the date picker under the "today" button to show any specific date.<p>You can quickly open the monthly timesheet by clicking on the month's name in the bottom left summary table.<p>To edit any day's record, click on the date you want to edit on the top row. A dialog will open where you can manually edit the records for that day.<figure><img src=../img/edit.png alt="Edition dialog"width=322px></figure><p>When it is time to fill the timesheet in Lionbridge's portal, LBTimer can fill it automatically for you with the recorded data. Just click one of the buttons shown below to automatically fill the timesheet with the AET (average estimated time) or the real time spent in the tasks.<figure><img src=../img/tsa.png alt="Timesheet auto-fill"width=541px> <span class=hl style=left:88px;top:22px;width:122px;height:20px title="LBTimer's timesheet auto-fill buttons"></span><figcaption>Timesheet auto-fill buttons</figcaption></figure><h3>Monthly Timesheet</h3><figure><img src=../img/monthts.png alt="Monthly timesheet"width=640px height=400px><figcaption>Monthly timesheet</figcaption></figure><p>The monthly timesheet shows the time spent in rating tasks during the month.

You can select at which total time's percentage you want to be warned from 50% to 95%.<li><b>When the timer reaches the AET:</b> A desktop notification will appear when the timer reaches the AET (average estimated time) for the current task. The notification will show a button to submit the task.<li><b>Daily/Weekly/Monthly goals:</b> A desktop notification will appear when you reach any of the configured time goals. To disable the goals notification set the goal time to zero.</ul><h3>Sounds</h3><ul class=bullets><li><b>When tasks available:</b> A bell will tinkle when the Rater Hub page is loaded and there are tasks available. You can also make the sound to be repeated until a task is acquired or no more tasks are available.<li><b>When timer reaches AET:</b> A bell will tinkle when the timer reaches the AET (average estimated time) for the current task.</ul><h3>Automation</h3><ul class=bullets><li><b>Auto-reload:</b> When there are no tasks available in the Rater Hub page, LBTimer will automatically refresh the page at the selected interval.<li><b>Autosubmit:</b> When this setting is active, LBTimer will submit the current task when the timer reaches the AET (average estimated time). NOTE: LBTimer will not check that the task is complete before trying to auto-submit it.<li><b>Autosubmit sooner:</b> With this setting active, the autosubmit feature will be triggered earlier if you are running behind AET in the tasks of the current type during the day. You can select how much sooner you allow the extension to try to auto-submit.<li><b>Autosubmit later:</b> With this setting active, the autosubmit feature will be triggered later if you are ahead of AET in the tasks of the current type during the day. You can select how much later you allow the extension to try to auto-submit.<li><b>Auto-acquire:</b> When this setting is active, LBTimer will acquire the first available task that matches the task type(s) selected. This feature is specially useful paired with auto-reload when tasks are scarce.<li><b>Auto-acquire only after NRT</b> This setting will cause auto-acquire to be triggered only if previously there were no available tasks. This way, if you land on the tasks index after completing a task you can manually choose which task to acquire, if any.</ul><h3>Timing</h3><ul class=bullets><li><b>Coundown clock:</b> This setting will cause the clock displayed in the extension's icon to count from the AET (average estimated time) to zero.<li><b>AET mode:</b> When active, the timesheets will display the time recorded according to the AET (average estimated time) for the tasks. In this mode, you can hover your mouse over any time cell to see the real time spent. If this setting is inactive, the timesheets will display only the real time. This setting only affects how the timings are displayed: regardless of it, LBTimer will always record both the AET and the real time spent in the tasks.<li><b>HH:MM format:</b> This setting will change how the totals are displayed in the weekly timesheet: if active, the times will be shown in hours:minutes (e.g: 2h 30m). When inactive, the toals will be displayed only in minutes (e.g: 150).<li><b>Check midnight passing:</b> When active, LBTimer will check the current date everytime the Rate Hub page is loaded/updated, in order to record the tasks completed in the corresponding day. With this setting inactive, all tasks will be recorded in the day the extension was started (usually when Chrome was opened).<li><b>Pacific time:</b> When active, LBTimer will use the Pacific timezone. This timezone may be a requirement of your vendor.<li><b>Continuous timer</b> When active, the timer will be automatically restarted as soon as a task is submitted, without waiting for the next task (if any) to be loaded. When inactive, the timer will stop when a task is submitted and restart when a new task is completely loaded. You can select a time threshold for the continuous timer so it works only on long tasks but not on short ones.</ul><h3>E-mail</h3><ul class=bullets><li><b>Send e-mail when tasks available:</b> An e-mail will be sent to the selected e-mail addresses when tasks are available in the Rater Hub page. You can select multiple e-mail addresses to be notified by separating them with semicolon (;). To prevent flooding the e-mail, the notification e-mail will be sent only if previously there were no tasks available.</ul><h3>Misc</h3><ul class=bullets><li><b>Rate-from-LP:</b> This setting will enable the experimental feature <a href=http://jsfiddle.net/2aem2j2n/ target=_blank>Rate-from-LP</a>, that shows a small rating panel in the NM and SXS tasks' landing pages opened with LBTimer's link openers. The panel will allow you to input your rating directly from the landing page. This way, you rate what you see while you see it, and also save time by not switching constanly between the task page and the landing pages.<li><b>Hourly wage:</b> Set your hourly wage so you can preview your expected earnings by hovering your mouse over the time cells in LBTimer's timesheets.</ul></div><div id=custom><h2>Custom Research links</h2><p>The custom research links are a new feature that allows you to quickly open relevant review results to evaluate webpages, for page quality tasks.<p>It allows you to write your own research links, so that you can create your own search queries that are relevant in your locale and language.<p>It uses a series of "wildcards" so you can quickly research the webpage and website of your task without having to write a new search query each time:<ul class=bullets><li>%url &rarr; the complete URL<li>%host &rarr; the hostname<li>%main &rarr; the main website, without subpages</ul><p>You can assign a label to each of the 5 possible web research links to easily identify them while completing the rating task.<p>Examples:<table><tr><td><b>Task URL:</b> http://www.bbc.co.uk/example/page/here<br><b>Task language:</b> English(UK)<br><span class=crl><span>LBTimer:</span> - <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc/page/here target=_blank>Open it!</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Is%20bbc.co.uk%20a%20scam%20-site%3Abbc.co.uk"target=_blank>Check scam</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wikipedia%20%22bbc.co.uk%22"target=_blank>Wiki</a></span><tr><td><table class=tcrl><tr><th>Label<th>Custom link<th>Action when clicked<tr><td>Open it!<td>%url<td>Opens the webpage http://www.bbc.co.uk/example/page/here<tr><td>Check scam<td>Is %host a scam -site:%host<td>Makes a web search &rarr; Is bbc.co.uk a scam -site:bbc.co.uk<tr><td>Wiki<td>wikipedia "%host"<td>Makes a web search &rarr; wikipedia "bbc.co.uk"</table><tr><td><b>Task URL:</b> https://m.lemonde.fr/francais/page/ici<br><b>Task language:</b> French(FR)<br><span class=crl><span>LBTimer:</span> - <a href=https://m.lemonde.fr target=_blank>Main page</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lemonde.fr%20r%C3%A9putation%20-site%3Alemonde.fr"target=_blank>Reputation</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lemonde.fr%22%20arnaque%20rapport">Scam</a><tr><td><table class=tcrl><tr><th>Label<th>Custom link<th>Action when clicked<tr><td>Main page<td>%main<td>Opens the webpage https://m.lemonde.fr<tr><td>Reputation<td>%host r&eacute;putation -site:%host<td>Makes a web search &rarr; lemonde.fr r&eacute;putation -site:lemonde.fr<tr><td>Scam<td>"%host" arnaque rapport<td>Makes a web search &rarr; "lemonde.fr" arnaque rapport</table><tr><td><b>Task URL:</b> http://www.newsradioklbj.com/news/austin-local-news/condo-scam-suspect-charged-burglary<br><b>Task language:</b> English(US)<br><span class=crl><span>LBTimer:</span> - <a href=http://www.newsradioklbj.com/news/austin-local-news/condo-scam-suspect-charged-burglary target=_blank>Open</a> - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=newsradioklbj.com%20site%3Aalexa.com"target=_blank>Alexa</a> - <a href="https://wikipedia.org/w/?search=newsradioklbj.com"target=_blank>Wiki</a><tr><td><table class=tcrl><tr><th>Label<th>Custom link<th>Action when clicked<tr><td>Open<td>%url<td>Opens the webpage http://www.newsradioklbj.com/news/austin-local-news/condo-scam-suspect-charged-burglary<tr><td>Alexa<td>%host site:alexa.com<td>Makes a web search &rarr; newsradioklbj.com site:alexa.com<tr><td>Wiki<td>https://wikipedia.org/w/?search=%host<td>Opens the webpage: https://wikipedia.org/w/?search=newsradioklbj.com</table></div></div>
